    caps at 131071 bytes for the whole `NAME=VALUE` — a limit the assigned documents outgrew.
    The platform writes both while the value still fits, so an old image and a new one both
    work and the two sides can be released in either order.

    Parsed once and re-parsed only when the file's mtime moves. A `stat` per call is free; the
    parse is not, since one payload runs to a couple of hundred kilobytes. The mtime check
    rather than a plain import-time parse is what lets a ConfigMap update reach a running pod
    later, when the platform learns to rewrite it outside a deploy — today nothing does, so
    this is equivalent to parsing once, and it costs eight lines to not have to remember.
